During my engineering studies, between the fourth and the fifth year, it is mandatory to
do a three-months engineering internship as a student. As I wanted to work abroad, I had the
opportunity to find a gap year at Thyssenkrupp Presta in Liechtenstein. The main purpose of this
internship was to support a developer team working on a big project for the automotive industries.

I helped them to create new functionalities, so I had to write two
Different DLL which were going to be used in their software. The first DLL I developed is a software
made for the communication with a specific printer in order to Print label on the production line.
My second DLL was a scanner software in order to some precise information and parse the data
receive in order to process it. 

The point was to create reusable functionalities and two user interfaces as visible here:
